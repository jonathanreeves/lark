- add code to install real interrupt and trap handlers for those with error
  codes (right now default interrupt handler has no error code)

- add kernel synchronization (semaphore, mutex, etc.)

- add PCI support. Should be simple and fairly easy. Just add bios support
  functions and add a couple of routines to build the list.

- add ATA/IDE block device support 

- port to ARM or other possible embedded architecture
